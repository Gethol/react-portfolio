		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm a Computer Science student from Strathmore University currently awaiting graduation.
			My interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, data analysis and back-end
			development.
			I have also dabbled in a bit of cloud computing with the Google Cloud Computing Platform as well as frontend development.
			<br />
			Outside of tech I have an interest in all things sports: football, basketball, handball, Formula 1 you name it.
			I also love my movies and listening to music. You can have a listen to one of my favourite songs at the moment.
